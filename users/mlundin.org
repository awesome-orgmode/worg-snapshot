I've been using Org-mode happily since 2008 and wish I had discovered
it sooner! 

* Here are a few tutorials I've written

 - [[file:../org-tutorials/advanced-searching.org][Advanced searching]]
 - [[file:../org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.org][Custom agenda commands]]
 - [[file:../org-tutorials/tracking-habits.org][Tracking habits with Org-mode]] (a bit out of date since the advent
   of org-habit.el)
