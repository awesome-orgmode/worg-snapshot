    =org-info.js= is now developed on github.com. Some of us plan to start a
    seperate tool to better support XHTML slides.

    Display speedbar in current frame with low overhead. It's working on console
    too. This is nice for use with Org-mode too:
    :(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'imenu-add-menubar-index)
    :(global-set-key [(hyper ?s)] 'sr-speedbar-toggle)
    Now you may open/toggle a speedbar in the current frame and navigate the
    structure of big orgfiles easily. [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/SrSpeedbarInXterm][Here]] is a screenshot in xterm.

    Most of the work since Mai 2008 is done by Andy Stewart actually.
